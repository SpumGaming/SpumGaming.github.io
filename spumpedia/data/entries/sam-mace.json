    "description": "During the final year of university (June 2021), when the chaps came up to Nottingham to have, when walking back from Town, they were reminiscing to remember the names of those in Sixth Form, and discussing the people there. For some reason or another (likely to do with the effects of alcohol) they were pretending to couple up two unsuspecting partners, and enjoying the humour of what that couple would look like. One such of these pairings was Sam Mace and Me - This was especially funny, as at the time, it sounded like the name of someone's autobiography."
