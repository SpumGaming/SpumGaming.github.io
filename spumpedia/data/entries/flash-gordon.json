    "description": "When the spummers came down to St. Albans in February 2022, they played Piccolo in James’ house (see Ping Hole). Many of the options/cards in the game were clearly setups to other cards for later on in the game, or instructions as to how to interact with the game throughout. Since a lot of these cards were boring, we skipped one. James left to grab a drink, and Robbie continued with the game. Since we weren’t necessarily paying attention to the fact  we skipped cards one appeared  reading “Fred, you are no longer Flash Gordon”. This therefore seemingly came  out of nowhere and was, for obvious reasons, really funny. Further on in the night, a friend of Robbie’s bone buddy asked if Fred TA was Iranian and his real name was Fouad, as she knew an Iranian chef who’s real name was Fouad but went by Fred. Both of these things happening in the same night led to the creation of “Fouad Gordon”"
