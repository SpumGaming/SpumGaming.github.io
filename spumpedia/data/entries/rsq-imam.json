    "description": "The origin of the comedic value behind this one is somewhat questionable. The early Spummers once played a non 5-stack match made game of CS:GO, and played with an incredibly salty teammate called RSQ, who pronounced eternal love to the Qaran. So of course when he threw round after round, and the Spummers needed to inspire some faith in him, they’d mention over voice chat that we’d tell his Imam of his throwing if he kept on doing it"
