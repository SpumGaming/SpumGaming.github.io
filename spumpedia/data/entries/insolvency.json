    "title": "Insolvency",
    "description": "While on a trip to Oxford and searching for breakfast the boys came across a deserted “All Bar One”, the only place taking walk-ins for food. What the boys weren’t to know however, was the sheer number of menu items missing due to a partner of the company allegedly becoming insolvent. This was hilarious to the boys, having already been declined a traditional breakfast menu by the restaurant numerous times despite them being the only customers in sight. This led the boys to believe that All Bar One itself was being placed under insolvency, and a reference to insolvency being brought with us to any establishment that refused a particular food item from their menu."
