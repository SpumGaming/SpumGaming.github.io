    "description": "'Chinese water torture or a 'dripping machine' is a mentally painful process in which cold water is slowly dripped onto the scalp, forehead or face for a prolonged period of time. The process causes fear and mental deterioration in the subject. The pattern of the drops is often irregular, and the cold sensation jarring, which causes anxiety as a person tries to anticipate the next drip.' but instead of the drip being of water, the chinese government dress you in Supreme and other hype brands , making you drippy as the form of torture.\n\nIn a discussion about torture methods on the famous Oxford trip, when trying to recollect the name of this method, Cian called it Chinese Drip torture, which prompted all of us to spout about how one could be tortured with a Gucci belt, Louis shoes, Bape hoodie and Suprieme jacket."
