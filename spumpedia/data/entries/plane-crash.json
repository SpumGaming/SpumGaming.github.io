    "description": "Back in computer science (A-Level), Mr Allday used a, somewhat broken, analogy of a plane crash to illustrate the respective forces between the read-write head of a hard drive hitting the platter. A few of us found this to be a funny comparison to make. This is related to the y2k meme about how planes allegedly “fall out of the sky” when the date hits 01/01/2000 00:00"
