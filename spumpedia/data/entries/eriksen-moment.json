    "description": "In the UEFA Euro 2020 cup, Denmark squad-player Christian Eriksen suffered cardiac arrest during the game. TV coverage was harrowing, frequently cutting to his grieving family and fans, all whilst CPR was being performed. After the Spummers found the player in good health, they coined the term 'An Eriksen Moment' to be referenced whenever someone fell over, was unresponsive etc."
