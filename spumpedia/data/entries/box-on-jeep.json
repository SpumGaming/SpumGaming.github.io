    "description": "When the spummers went to Oxford, they noticed an interesting sign when leaving the Oxford car park at the bottom of town. The sign in question, whilst  actually signalling what is and isn’t appropriate to bring into the car park, looked as though it was telling you what you are and aren’t allowed to be in the car park.\nThe sign: You cannot be a giant, you can be a Jeep, but you cannot be a box on top of a Jeep. You can also be a tiny disabled person, but only on level -2",
