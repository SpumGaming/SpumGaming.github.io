    "description": "From the first beta of the video game Rematch, when Rhodri’s in-game name was “John Tickle”, he would constantly sit in the back right corner near the enemy’s goal. It was therefore dubbed the “Tickle Corner” and the corner on the other side being named the “Anti Tickle Corner”. Later on, James referred to it was the “Andy Tickle Corner”."
