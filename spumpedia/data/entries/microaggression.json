    "description": "During a weekend when the spummers visited Nottingham in 2020, whilst walking back to Josh and Felix’s house on Allington Avenue, Cian was regaling us with a story about how the University of Sheffield employes students (paying them hourly wages) to eavesdrop on other student’s conversations in public, and report microaggressions. This prompted a long jokey discussion about what these Lidl own-brand Sherlock Holmes’ may call people up on."
