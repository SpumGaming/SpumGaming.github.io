    "description": "Originated from the Oxford trip of 2021. Around the time 'Insulate Britain' were a group of protestors that were gaining publicity for blocking a lot of motorways and generally causing a lot of hassle. Their main demand was for the UK government to add insulation to all buildings in the UK to reduce carbon emissions, but that just seemed such an odd thing considering thereâ€™s things so much more damaging to the environment than just slightly more energy being used to heat homes."
