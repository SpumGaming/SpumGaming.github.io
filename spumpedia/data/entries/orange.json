    "description": "In a classic competitive game of CS:GO Fred and Felix happened apon an interesting character, who weâ€™ll say goes by the name of Orange. This distinguished individual was a very toxic team-player, who was no stranger to voicing his outrage at his fellow counter terrorists. The notable comedic fact in question, was that this fellow always seemed terribly our of breath, one might say 'exasperated'. We would mock this esteemed colleague by returningly voicing our upset at him, in an over-the-top fashion, emphasising the anaerobic removal of lactic acid through heavy breathing."
