    "description": "When booking a table at 12:45 at St. Albans Sushimania for two people, communication broke down over the phone when Felix tried desperately to make a booking for 12:45 for 2 people, yet the gentleman at the other end of the phone was convinced he meant a table at 2pm. After clarifying the time was 12:45, the waiter over the phone said “for 12 45 people?” I’m gonna be honest right here, I was in stitches. If he said that, he must have thought I meant 1 of 2 things, either a) I was expecting 1245 individuals to be served at, or I was giving him a range of people expected to be eating. This had me laughing for obvious reasons"
