    "description": "James & Sabina’s humble basement abode in St Albans. Due to it being a basement, it was referred to as “The Ping Hole” as it was a hole in the ground. The location has been allegedly used by the spummers to watch a variety of films from our childhood under the influence of narcotics.\nThey later moved to an actual house and this was dubbed “The Ping Home” as it was an upgrade from the hole, but still the place the spummers allegedly chose to ping (until the creation of 49c Chester Way)."
