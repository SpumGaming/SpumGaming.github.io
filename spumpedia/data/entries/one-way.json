    "description": "Smoke grenades in CS:GO have the main purpose of blocking vision but have the strange quirk where the vision obscured isn’t quite the same depending on where someone is positioned, so one person might be able to see the other on the other side, while the other can’t, this is a one way. One ways are essentially a free kill, and so asserting that any smoke used is a one way to the enemy even when it obviously isn’t is just another classic thing to spam to make them angry.",
