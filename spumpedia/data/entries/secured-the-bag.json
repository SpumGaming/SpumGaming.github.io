    "description": "In CS:GO you can buy weapons and equipment with money, you earn this money by winning / losing rounds, completing objectives (usually planting the bomb) or by killing enemies. Different guns have different 'kill bounties' - the amount of money you get for killing someone with it, the base amount being $300. Shotguns have a ridiculous $900 kill bounty while being incredibly cheap to buy, and are famously bad (but we apparently did well with them) so by killing anyone with a shotgun, no matter how bad the rest of the round went it would be standard practice to say you 'secured the bag' to tilt the enemies."
